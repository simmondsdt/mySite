            An 11 week Full Stack Ruby on Rails Web Developer course that teaches best practices for recent and relevant programming practices. Every day we were given a lecture in the morning about our next lesson and then in the afternoon we had open lab time to work on homework, ask the teachers and TAâ€™s questions, and even work on personal projects. I participated in many group and personal projects that used all of the knowledge I learned through the course and through my own teachings. My final project that I worked on with my team was Devume and can be found here -> <a href='https://devume.herokuapp.com' target='_blank'>Devume</a>
